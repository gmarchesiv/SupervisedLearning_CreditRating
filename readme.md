# Supervised learning applied to transaction approval 

This notebook contains the analysis for a series of credit scoring models for a direct account payment gateway company. 
A payment gateway is a merchant service provided by an e-commerce application service provider that authorizes credit card or direct payments processing for e-businesses, online retailers, bricks and clicks, or traditional brick and mortar.
This particular gateway company authorizes direct payments to merchants from customers bank accounts. The gateway has no online connection to banks, so it must rely on its own scoring models to determine which customers to approve. 
Bad transactions occur when customers do not have funds in their accounts at the time. Merchants get paid immediately, so default risk stays with the gateway company. 

The models are based on two independent provider scores. The analysis presents alternative credit socring models using supervised machine learning methods. The data is from a private company. Only features pertaining to the analysis are shown in the dataset.
